Making a Multiplayer FPS in Unity
========

This project is my realization of the 32 part Brackys Muti-player FPS project.  

While it follows closely to what the original author created
I have often re-factored the code to suit my self.

Everything is/was running upon upload.
You will need to set up a unity account to use the match maker service.

You will also need to download the free version of database control for the project to function.

You will also have to download the unity Standard Assets package

Learn how to make a multi-player first-person shooter in Unity. This series teaches the very cool Unity Networking system (uNet). All code is written entirely in C#.
